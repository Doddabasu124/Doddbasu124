## Contents
* **Machine Learning**
  1. [Predicting household poverty in Latin America](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Income%20qualification):
     * Exploratory data Analysis of the datasets using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
     * Utilized python to implement supervised machine learning techniques to identify the level of income qualification needed for the families in Latin America.
     * Performed Data preprocessing, feature selection to train Random Forest classifier and Random search CV models and achieved the accuracy of 96%.
  
  2. [Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Mercedes-Benz%20Greener%20Manufacturing/Benz_model.ipynb):
     * Created a model which reduce the time of a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.
     * Improved accuracy of model by performing Stacked Regressor by combining the linear regression, Random Forest regressor & XGBoost regression models.
     
   *Tools*: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
   
 
* **Natural Language Processing**
  1. [Chatbot](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/NLP/Chatbot):
     * Built a Retrieval based customer support chatbot to guide the audience and answer any queries related to Healthcare.                               
     * Performed Text Preprocessing, Bag-of-words to train the Neural network.

  2. [Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/blob/main/NLP/Sentiment%20Analysis/CNN_Autoencoder.ipynb)
      * Created 1D Convolutional Neural Network Model to predict 0(Negative) or 1(Positive) for a given user review.
      * Applied **Sparse Autoencoder technique** to learn redundant features for given dataset.
     
   *Tools*: NLTK, Keras
  
 
* **Deep Learning**:
   1. [Multilayer perceptron](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/MLP):
      * Building comprehensible neural network(multilayer perceptron) using Python libraries and successfully train it to classify the type of Iris plant using Iris            dataset. 
  
   2. [Facial Recognition](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/Deep%20Learning/Facial%20Recognition):
      * Designed Convolutional Neural Net(CNN) model to identify different face.                               
      * Performed Data Augmentation to train CNN model and achieved the accuracy 95%.                                                        

   3. [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/Deep%20Learning/Diabetic%20Retinopathy%20Detection):
      * Developed Neural network model to classify retinopathy level for given eye image.                                                                              
      * Performed Image Augmentation to prevent the overfitting.
      * Used Transferred Learning to train neural network on 1500 images to classify Diabetic retinopathy level.

   *Tools*: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
