# Data Science Portfolio
This repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and markdown files.


## Contents
* **Machine Learning**
  1. [Predicting household poverty in Latin America](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/Income%20qualification):
     * Exploratory data Analysis of the datasets using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
     * Utilized python to implement supervised machine learning techniques to identify the level of income qualification needed for the families in Latin America.
     * Performed Data preprocessing, feature selection to train Random Forest classifier and Random search CV models and achieved the accuracy of 96%.
  
  2. [Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/Mercedes-Benz%20Greener%20Manufacturing):
     * Created a model which reduce the time of a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.
     * Improved accuracy of model by performing Stacked Regressor by combining the linear regression, Random Forest regressor & XGBoost regression models.
     
   *Tools*: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
   
 
* **Natural Language Processing**
  1. [Chatbot](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/NLP/Chatbot):
     * Built a Retrieval based customer support chatbot to guide the audience and answer any queries related to Healthcare.                               
     * Performed Text Preprocessing, Bag-of-words to train the Neural network.
     
   *Tools*: NLTK, Keras
  
 
* **Deep Learning**:
  1. [Facial Recognition](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/Computer%20Vision/Facial%20Recognition):
     * Designed Convolutional Neural Net(CNN) model to identify different face.                               
     * Performed Data Augmentation to train CNN model and achieved the accuracy 95%.

   2. [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/Computer%20Vision/Diabetic%20Retinopathy%20Detection):
      * Developed Neural network model to classify retinopathy level for given eye image.                                                                                         
      *	Performed Image Augmentation to prevent the overfitting.
      *	Used Transferred Learning to train neural network on 1500 images to classify Diabetic retinopathy level.

   *Tools*: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
