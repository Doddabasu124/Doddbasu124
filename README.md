# Data Science Portfolio
This repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and markdown files.


## Contents
* **Machine Learning**
  1. [Predicting household poverty in Latin America](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/Income%20qualification):
     * Exploratory data Analysis of the datasets using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
     * Utilized python to implement supervised machine learning techniques to identify the level of income qualification needed for the families in Latin America.
     * Performed Data preprocessing, feature selection to train Random Forest classifier and Random search CV models and achieved the accuracy of 96%.
  
  2. [Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing](https://github.com/Doddabasu124/Doddbasu124/tree/main/Mercedes-Benz%20Greener%20Manufacturing):
     * Created a model which reduce the time of a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.
     * Improved accuracy of model by performing Stacked Regressor by combining the linear regression, Random Forest regressor & XGBoost regression models.




Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
